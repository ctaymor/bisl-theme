# bisl-theme
A little theme for the [Hugo blogging framework](https://gohugo.io/), developed for my site tech.taymor.io. It presumes you [celebrate acheivements with donuts](http://larahogan.me/donuts/). It is designed to host a basic portfolio site and blog.

What is a bisl? In Yiddish, [a bisl](http://www.jewish-languages.org/jewish-english-lexicon/words/67) is a little bit. Bisl-theme is a stylistically little Hugo theme, with minimalist design. We don't, however, have a bisl of opinions that you should celebrate your career acheivements with donuts. We have a lot.
